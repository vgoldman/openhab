/**
 * An adapter that works as a bridge between the logging API of calimero and slf4j.
 *
 * Calimero (the KNX I/O library used by this binding) has its own and very specific logging framework,
 * which is not compatible with any default logging framework. Thus, this specific adapter is necessary
 * in order to build a bridge between the calimero logging framework and the API of slf4j.
 *
 * All logging events from calimero are written to a single slf4j logger named <code>tuwien.auto.calimero</code>.
