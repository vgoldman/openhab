 *
 * In all of the defined methods below, "ProtocolCommand" is the 'command' to be
 * executed by the protocol, which is mapped on a openHAB Command through the binding
 * configuration. See TCP and UDP implementations. In a lot of protocols the ProtocolCommand
 * will just be a (data)string that is sent "as is" to the remote-end
