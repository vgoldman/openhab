/**
 * A {@link CommandConverter} converts between an openHAB {@link State} and an
 * openHAB {@link Command}.<br>
 * This is one of the two central converter types. To implement an own converter
 * you have to subclass this one and implement the abstract method
 * {@link #convertImpl(State, Command)}. <br>
 * The command receiving has two parts:<br>
 * The command is first converter to a state with this converter. This new state
 * is then set on the corresponding binding (normally by converting it to a
 * binding protocol value and sending it).
 *
 * A {@link CommandConverter} is used like
 * <code>converterFactory.addCommandConverter("LEVEL", OnOffType.class, OnOffPercentageCommandConverter.class);</code>
